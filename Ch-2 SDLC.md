SDLC -> Software development lifecycle
<div>SDLC ka full form hai Software Development Life Cycle.

Simple ginglish mein bolein to â€”
SDLC ek process hai jisme step-by-step software banaya, test kiya aur deliver kiya jata hai.

Jaise jaise ek building banane ke liye pehle planning, design, construction aur finishing hoti hai, waise hi software banane ke liye bhi kuch stages follow karte hain.

Normally SDLC ke main steps hote hain:

    1) Planning (kya banana hai sochna)

    2) Requirement Analysis (exact kya chahiye woh samajhna)

    3) Design (kaisa dikhega aur kaise kaam karega decide karna)

    4) Development (actual coding karna)

    5) Testing (dekhna sab sahi chal raha hai ya nahi)

    6) Deployment (software ko logo ke use ke liye launch karna)

    7) Maintenance (baad mein bugs fix karna, naye features add karna)

Ek tarah se SDLC ek roadmap hoti hai taaki software efficiently aur sahi tarike se ban sake.</div>

Goal is to give high quality product

planning -> defining -> designing -> building -> testing -> deploy -> planning ->

Suppose example.com sells clothes for men and women, now it want to add children setion also.
So it have to go through the above mentioned cycle
1) fundamental step (planning + requirement)
2) Defining (questioning what we need)
3) Desigining 
4) devops engineer role starts from building to deployment. It is very crucial step.
5) Devops engineer fastens this process.
